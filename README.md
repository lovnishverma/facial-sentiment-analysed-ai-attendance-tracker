Face and Emotion Recognition-Based Attendance System

• This project is an AI-powered attendance system that utilizes face 

recognition and emotion detection to mark attendance 

automatically. Built using Streamlit, OpenCV, Face Recognition, and 

Deep Learning (CNN), the system captures real-time video input 

from a webcam, recognizes registered faces, and detects emotions. 

Attendance data, including name, roll number, date, time, and 

detected emotions, is stored in an SQLite database for easy 

retrieval. The system also allows users to register new faces and 

view attendance records in a structured format. This project is 

ideal for schools, colleges, offices, or any organization that wants to 

automate attendance while incorporating an innovative emotion-

tracking feature.
